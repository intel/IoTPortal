    IoT Portal
  </a>
</h1>

IoT Portal is a web application that interacts with Intel In-Band Manageability to provide remote over-the-air (OTA) updates to IoT devices. It supports Firmware OTA (FOTA), Software OTA (SOTA), Application OTA (AOTA) and Configuration OTA (COTA). 

- Supports FOTA, SOTA, AOTA and COTA features.
- Device categorization feature.
- Device grouping feature.
- Saved command feature.
- Mass OTA update feature.
- Robust Mass OTA background job processing.

## üìã Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (already included with some Docker installations)

*These dependencies are free to use.*

## üîß Installation

You can install IoT Portal using Docker containers on Linux distributions. Use the provided Bash scripts to get started quickly.

### Linux

Navigate to the `scripts` directory and give it permission to execute:

```shell
cd scripts && chmod +x *
```

Run the installation script. A `./iotportaldata` directory will be created.

```shell
./iotportal.sh install 
```

Finally, start your IoT Portal instance.

```shell
./iotportal.sh start 
```

Migrate the database for the first run.

```shell
./iotportal.sh migrateDb 
```

Seed the database.

```shell
./iotportal.sh seedDb 
```

To seed the database with sample data, run the command below. A random generated user will be created with the password defaulted to `password`.

*ONLY TRY THIS ON DEVELOPMENT INSTANCE! THIS IS FOR YOU TO EXPERIMENT THE FEATURES WITHOUT ACTUALLY PROVISIONING A DEVICE.*

```shell
./iotportal.sh seedDbSample 
```

By default, the script uses values in the `.env.staging` file for deployment. You should replace those default credentials, e.g. `DB_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `MQTT_PASSWORD` etc.  with your own randomly generated password for production deployment.

## üìñ Script Commands Reference

Command | Description
---------------------- | ------------------------------------
`install` | Start the installer.
`start` | Start all containers.
`restart`	| Restart all containers (same as start).
`stop` | Stop all containers.
`rebuild`	| Rebuild generated installation assets.
`migrateDb` | Update/initialize the database.
`seedDb` | Seed all required data for first run.
`seedDbSample` | Seed the database with sample data. (Development use only)
`clearDb` | Clear the entire database. (Development use only)
`help` | List all commands.

*Use these commands cautiously. Some commands are intended for development purpose only.*
